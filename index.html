#NodeSchool Lodz

## Idea

NodeSchool is an open project of free workshops organized to help people learn Node.js. It is aimed both for programmers who know nothing about Node.js and for Node.js programmers who want to learn new things. You can read more at the <a href="http://nodeschool.io" target="_blank">official NodeSchool website</a>.

NodeSchool Lodz was started by <a href="http://goodylabs.com" target="_blank">goodylabs</a> and is supported by GFT, but it's an open initiative. If you want to help, contact Krzysztof (k.zbicinski at gmail.com).

## Next meeting

The next meeting details will be published very soon. 
Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/nodeschool_lodz" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nodeschoollodz" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to stay updated.

**We are looking for mentors!** Don't worry, it's as easy as coming to the workshops and answering questions from participants. If you know how to Node and want to help others, contact Krzysztof (k.zbicinski at gmail.com).
