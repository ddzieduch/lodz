## Idea



NodeSchool is an open project of free workshops organized to help people learn Node.js. It is aimed both for programmers who know nothing about Node.js and for Node.js programmers who want to learn new things. You can read more at the <a href="http://nodeschool.io" target="_blank">official NodeSchool website</a>.


NodeSchool Lodz was started by <a href="http://goodylabs.com" target="_blank">goodylabs</a>, but it's an open initiative. If you want to help, join the conversation on our <a href="https://gitter.im/nodeschool/lodz" target="_blank">gitter channel</a>.
