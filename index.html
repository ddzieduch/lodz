## Idea



NodeSchool is an open project of free workshops organized to help people learn Node.js. It is aimed both for programmers who know nothing about Node.js and for Node.js programmers who want to learn new things. You can read more at the <a href="http://nodeschool.io" target="_blank">official NodeSchool website</a>.


NodeSchool Lodz was started by <a href="http://goodylabs.com" target="_blank">goodylabs</a> and is supported by GFT, but it's an open initiative. If you want to help, contact <a href="mailto:adamsunday@gmail.com">Adam</a>.

## Next meeting

Date: 30.01.2016 10:00 - 16:00

Location: GFT office, Sterlinga 8a

Registration: <a href="https://ti.to/nodeschool-lodz/workshop-4/" target="_blank">ti.to</a> (starts 15.01.2016 12:00)

This is a special meeting because we are going to focus on a single theme - MongoDB. The workshops will be led by <a href="https://twitter.com/WSztajerowski" target="_blank">Wiktor Sztajerowski</a>. Please note that **basic understanding of Node.js is required** this time. Basic understanding of Node.js means:

a) attending one of previous workshops OR

b) completing <a href="https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode" target="_blank">learnyounode workshop</a> at home

**We are looking for mentors!** Don't worry, it's as easy as coming to the workshops and answering questions from participants. If you know how to Node and want to help others, contact <a href="mailto:adamsunday@gmail.com">Adam</a>.
