#NodeSchool Lodz

## Idea

NodeSchool is an open project of free workshops organized to help people learn Node.js. It is aimed both for programmers who know nothing about Node.js and for Node.js programmers who want to learn new things. You can read more at the <a href="http://nodeschool.io" target="_blank">official NodeSchool website</a>. NodeSchool Lodz is an open initiative. It was started by <a href="http://goodylabs.com" target="_blank">goodylabs</a> and has received support from companies like GFT or Comarch.

## Last meeting

* 'Elasticsearch - introduction' by Karol BÅ‚aszczyk

<!--## How to prepare for the workshops?

 * Make sure to bring your own laptop with the AC adapter,

 * <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">download and install latest Node.js</a>,
 
 * install `count-to-6` workshopper by typing `npm install -g count-to-6` in the console,
 
 * run `count-to-6` to see if it doesn't blow up.-->
